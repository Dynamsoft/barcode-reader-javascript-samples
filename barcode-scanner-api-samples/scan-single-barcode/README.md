# ðŸ“¦ Scan Single Barcode - Hello World

This sample demonstrates how to use the `BarcodeScanner` API from the [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/) to scan a **single barcode** from a video stream using plain JavaScript.

## âœ¨ Features

- Uses `BarcodeScanner` APIs from `dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle`
- Scans a single barcode at a time
- UI rendered to a container element

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The sample uses the `BarcodeScanner` class to launch a scanner and decode barcodes from a camera stream. The key configuration includes:

- **License Key** â€“ Required to activate the SDK.
- **`engineResourcePaths`** â€“ Points to required resources hosted on a CDN or locally.
- **UI container** â€“ An HTML element where the scanner is rendered.

```ts
const config = {
  license: "YOUR-LICENSE-KEY",
  engineResourcePaths: {
    // feel free to change it to your own path
    rootDirectory: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle@10.5.1000/dist/",
  },
  container: ".barcode-scanner-view",
};
```

The barcodeScanner is launched like this:

```ts
const barcodeScanner = new Dynamsoft.BarcodeScanner(config);
barcodeScanner.launch();
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This sample scans **single barcode**, you can configure the `scanMode` to control this behavior.
- To avoid network-related loading issues, you can consider hosting all required resources locally.
