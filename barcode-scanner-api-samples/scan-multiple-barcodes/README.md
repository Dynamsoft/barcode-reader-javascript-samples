# ðŸ“¦ Scan Multiple Barcodes Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the `BarcodeScanner` API from the [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/) to scan **multiple barcodes continuously** from a video stream in a web application.

## âœ¨ Features

- Scan multiple 1D/2D barcodes
- Live video decoding using `BarcodeScanner` component
- Easy integration into your web application
- UI rendered into a customizable container

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

The sample uses the `BarcodeScanner` class to launch a scanner and decode barcodes from a camera stream. The key configuration includes:

- **License Key** â€“ Required to activate the SDK.
- **`engineResourcePaths`** â€“ Points to required resources hosted on a CDN or locally.
- **UI container** â€“ An HTML element where the scanner is rendered.

```ts
const config = {
  license: "YOUR-LICENSE-KEY",
  engineResourcePaths: {
    // feel free to change it to your own path
    rootDirectory: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle@10.5.1000/dist/",
  },
  container: ".barcode-scanner-view",
  scanMode: Dynamsoft.EnumScanMode.SM_MULTI_UNIQUE,
  showResultView: true,
  showUploadImageButton: true,
  scannerViewConfig: {
    showCloseButton: true
  },
};
```

The BarcodeScanner instance is created and launched like this:

```ts
const barcodeScanner = new Dynamsoft.BarcodeScanner(config);
barcodeScanner.launch();
```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This sample scans **multiple unique barcodes**, you can configure `scanMode` to change the behavior to scan one single barcode.
- To avoid network-related loading issues, consider hosting all required resources locally.

## ðŸ“„ See other BarcodeScanner samples

Multiple samples are provided for single barcode scanning. These samples can be easily adapted to scan multiple unique barcodes by simply updating the `config` object.
