# ðŸ“¦ Scan Multiple Barcodes Samples

## ðŸš€ 1. Hello World

This sample demonstrates how to use the `BarcodeScanner` API from the [Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK](https://www.dynamsoft.com/barcode-reader/docs/web/programming/javascript/) to scan **multiple barcodes continuously** from a video stream in a web application.

### âœ¨ Features

- Scan multiple 1D/2D barcodes
- Live video decoding using `BarcodeScanner` component
- Easy integration into your web application
- UI rendered into a customizable container

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

The sample uses the `BarcodeScanner` class to launch a scanner and decode barcodes from a camera stream. The key configuration includes:

- **License Key** â€“ Required to activate the SDK.
- **`engineResourcePaths`** â€“ Points to required resources hosted on a CDN or locally.
- **UI container** â€“ An HTML element where the scanner is rendered.

```ts
const config = {
  license: "YOUR-LICENSE-KEY",
  engineResourcePaths: {
    // feel free to change it to your own path
    rootDirectory: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-barcode-reader-bundle@11.0.3000/dist/",
  },
  container: ".barcode-scanner-view",
  scanMode: Dynamsoft.EnumScanMode.SM_MULTI_UNIQUE,
  showResultView: true,
  showUploadImageButton: true,
  scannerViewConfig: {
    showCloseButton: true
  },
};
```

The BarcodeScanner instance is created and launched like this:

```ts
const barcodeScanner = new Dynamsoft.BarcodeScanner(config);
barcodeScanner.launch();
```

### ðŸ“Œ Notes

- This sample scans **multiple unique barcodes**, you can configure `scanMode` to change the behavior to scan one single barcode.
- To avoid network-related loading issues, consider hosting all required resources locally.

## ðŸ›’ 2. Cart Builder

This sample simulates a shopping experience where users scan barcodes to add items to a dynamic cart. 

### âœ¨ Features

- Scan multiple 1D/2D barcodes
- Live video decoding using `BarcodeScanner` component
- Floating and draggable scanner window.
- Dynamic cart updates on each scan.

### ðŸ”§ How It Works

The scanning logic mirrors the Hello World sample, but scanned results populate the cart instead of just displaying in the result view.

The UI features a "Scan Barcode" button, a styled cart, and basic interactivity with vanilla JavaScript and CSS.

A list of 20 dummy products is used, with each scan randomly adding a product to the cart showing its name, shortened barcode, and price.
