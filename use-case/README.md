## Read Barcodes and Fill Form Fields

It's difficult to type long text on mobile devices, but if that text is encoded in a barcode, we can use the sdk to read the barcode and automatically enter the text.

The following sample demonstrates how to utilize the SDK to fill out form fields.

## Read the PDF417 Barcode on the Driver's License

The PDF417 barcode on an AAMVA compatible driver's license contains a lot of information which is encoded following the DL/ID Card Design Standard. Together with a simple parse function, we can use the SDK to read and extract the information.

The following official sample shows how to use the sdk to read and extract driver's license information.

## Read barcodes via camera and show result texts on the video

When the SDK picks up a barcode in video stream, it will highlight them with built-in style automatically. But it is also possible to show the text of the barcode on the video with the help of the function `convertToPageCoordinates()` or `convertToClientCoordinates()`.

The following official sample shows how to show result texts on the video.

## Locate an Item via Barcode

Searcing for a specific item among numerous identical boxes can be challenging. However, with the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader (DBR) SDK, we'll be able to locate the item quickly by scanning through the barcodes.

The following sample demonstrates how to utilize the SDK to find an item using a barcode among many barcodes.

Additionally, this sample demonstrates how to utilize the SDK to fill out form fields, creating a custom UI with [Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer (DCE)](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/core/introduction/index.html), and using DCE to draw shapes/images on the CameraView to create indicators for each barcode that has been detected!
