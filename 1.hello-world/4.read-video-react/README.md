# JavaScript Hello World Sample - React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library meant explicitly for creating interactive UIs. Follow this guide to learn how to implement Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK (hereafter called "the library") into a React application. Note that in this sample we will use `TypeScript` and define components as classes. Also, there is another sample `read-video-react-hooks` showing using `Hooks` in React.

## Official Sample

* <a target = "_blank" href="https://demo.dynamsoft.com/Samples/DBR/JS/1.hello-world/4.read-video-react/build/">Hello World in React - Demo</a>
* <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/tree/main/1.hello-world/4.read-video-react">Hello World in React - Source Code</a>

## Preparation

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. `node 14.21.3` and `react 18.2.0` used in the example below.

## Create the sample project

### Create a Bootstrapped Raw React Application with TypeScript

```cmd
npx create-react-app read-video-react --template typescript
```

### **CD** to the root directory of the application and install the library

```cmd
cd read-video-react
npm install dynamsoft-javascript-barcode
```

## Start to implement

### Add a file "dbr.ts" under "/src/" to configure the library

```ts
import { BarcodeReader } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode';
BarcodeReader.license = 'DLS2eyJvcmdhbml6YXRpb25JRCI6IjIwMDAwMSJ9';
BarcodeReader.engineResourcePath = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode/dist/";
```

> Note:
>
> * `license` specify a license key to use the library. You can visit https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?utm_source=sample&product=dbr&package=js to get your own trial license good for 30 days.
> * `engineResourcePath` tells the library where to get the necessary resources at runtime.

### Build directory structure

* Create a directory "components" under "/src/", and then create another three directories "HelloWorld", "VideoDecode" and "ImgDecode" under "/src/components/".

### Create and edit the `VideoDecode` component

* Create `VideoDecode.tsx` and `VideoDecode.css` under "/src/components/VideoDecode/". The `VideoDecode` component uses `BarcodeScanner` class of the library to decode barcodes via camera.

* In `VideoDecode.tsx`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeScanner` instance.

```tsx
import { BarcodeScanner } from "dynamsoft-javascript-barcode";
import React from 'react';
import './VideoDecode.css'

class VideoDecode extends React.Component {
    pScanner: Promise<BarcodeScanner>|null = null;
    elRef: React.RefObject<HTMLDivElement> = React.createRef();
    async componentDidMount() {
        try {
            const scanner = await (this.pScanner = BarcodeScanner.createInstance());
            // Should judge if scanner is destroyed after 'await', as in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup in Strict Mode. 
            if(scanner.isContextDestroyed()) return;
            await scanner.setUIElement(this.elRef.current!);
            // Should judge if scanner is destroyed after 'await', as in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup in Strict Mode. 
            if(scanner.isContextDestroyed()) return;
            scanner.onFrameRead = results => {
                for (let result of results) {
                    console.log(result.barcodeText);
                }
            };
            scanner.onUniqueRead = (txt, result) => {
                alert(txt);
            }
            await scanner.open();
        } catch (ex: any) {
            if (ex.message.indexOf("network connection error")) {
                let customMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
                console.log(customMsg);
                alert(customMsg);
            }
            throw ex;
        }
    }
    async componentWillUnmount() {
        if (this.pScanner) {
            (await this.pScanner).destroyContext();
            console.log('BarcodeScanner Component Unmount');
        }
    }
    shouldComponentUpdate() {
        // Never update UI after mount, dbrjs sdk use native way to bind event, update will remove it.
        return false;
    }
    render() {
        return (

### Create and edit the `ImgDecode` component

* Create `ImgDecode.tsx` and `ImgDecode.css` under "/src/components/ImgDecode/". The `ImgDecode` component uses `BarcodeReader` class of the library to help decode barcodes in an image.

* In `ImgDecode.tsx`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeReader` instance.

```tsx
import React, { ChangeEvent, Component } from 'react'
import { BarcodeReader } from "dynamsoft-javascript-barcode";
import './ImgDecode.css'

export default class ImgDecode extends Component {
  pReader: Promise<BarcodeReader> = BarcodeReader.createInstance();

  decodeImg = async (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    try {
      const reader = await this.pReader;
      let results = await reader.decode(e.target.files![0]);
      for (let result of results) {
        alert(result.barcodeText);
      }
      if (!results.length) { alert('No barcode found'); }
    } catch (ex: any) {
      if (ex.message.indexOf("network connection error")) {
        let customMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
        console.log(customMsg);
        alert(customMsg);
      }
      throw ex;
    }
    e.target.value = '';

  async componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.pReader) {
      (await this.pReader).destroyContext();
      console.log('ImgDecode Component Unmount');
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="ImgDecode"><input type="file" onChange={this.decodeImg} /></div>
    )
  }
}
```

* Define the style of the element in `ImgDecode.css`

```css
.ImgDecode {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border: 1px solid black
}
```

### Create and edit the HelloWorld component

* Create `HelloWorld.tsx` and `HelloWorld.css` under "/src/components/HelloWorld/". The `HelloWorld` component offers buttons to switch components between `VideoDecode` and `ImgDecode`;

* Add following code to `HelloWorld.tsx`.

```tsx
import './HelloWorld.css';
import reactLogo from '../../logo.svg';
import "../../dbr"; // import side effects. The license, engineResourcePath, so on.
import { BarcodeReader } from "dynamsoft-javascript-barcode";
import React from 'react';
import VideoDecode from '../VideoDecode/VideoDecode';
import ImgDecode from '../ImgDecode/ImgDecode';

interface isState {
    bShowScanner: boolean,
    bShowImgDecode: boolean
}

class HelloWorld extends React.Component<any, isState> {
    state = {
        bShowScanner: true,
        bShowImgDecode: false
    };
    
    async componentDidMount() {
        try {
            await BarcodeReader.loadWasm();
        } catch (ex: any) {
            if (ex.message.indexOf("network connection error")) {
                let customMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
                console.log(customMsg);
                alert(customMsg);
            }
            throw ex;
        }
    }

    showScanner = () => {
        this.setState({
            bShowScanner: true,
            bShowImgDecode: false
        });
    }

    showImgDecode = () => {
        this.setState({
            bShowScanner: false,
            bShowImgDecode: true
        });
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div className="helloWorld">
                <h1>Hello World for React<img src={reactLogo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" /></h1>
                <div>
                    <button style={{ marginRight: '10px', backgroundColor: this.state.bShowScanner ? 'rgb(255,174,55)' : 'white' }} onClick={this.showScanner}>Video Decode</button>
                    <button style={{ backgroundColor: this.state.bShowImgDecode ? 'rgb(255,174,55)' : 'white' }} onClick={this.showImgDecode}>Image Decode</button>
                </div>
                <div className="container">
                    {this.state.bShowScanner ? (<VideoDecode></VideoDecode>) : ""}
                    {this.state.bShowImgDecode ? (<ImgDecode></ImgDecode>) : ""}
                </div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
export default HelloWorld;
```

> NOTE :
>
> * The method `loadWasm()` initializes the library in the background.

* Define the style of the element in `HelloWorld.css`

```css
.helloWorld {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    color: #455A64;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
}

button {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    margin: 1.5vh 0;
    border: 1px solid black;
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}

.container {
    margin: 2vmin auto;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: medium;
    width: 80vw;
}
```

### Add the `HelloWorld` component to `App.tsx`

Edit the file `App.tsx` to be like this

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld/HelloWorld';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <HelloWorld></HelloWorld>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

* Try running the project.

```cmd
npm start
```

If you have followed all the steps correctly, you should now have a functioning page that allows you to scan barcodes from a webcam or a built-in camera. Additionally, if you want to decode a local image, you can click the `Image Decode` button and select the image you want to decode. Any barcodes that are detected will be displayed in a dialog.

## Development server

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
