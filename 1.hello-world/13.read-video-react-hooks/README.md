# JavaScript Hello World Sample - React with Hooks

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library meant explicitly for creating interactive UIs. Follow this guide to learn how to implement Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK (hereafter called "the library") into a React application. Note that in this sample we will use `TypeScript` and [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Also, there is another sample `read-video-react` showing defining components as classes in React.

## Official Sample

* <a target = "_blank" href="https://demo.dynamsoft.com/Samples/DBR/JS/1.hello-world/4.read-video-react/build/">Hello World in React - Demo</a>
* <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/tree/main/1.hello-world/4.read-video-react">Hello World in React - Source Code</a>

## Preparation

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. `node 14.21.3` and `react 18.2.0` used in the example below.

## Create the sample project

### Create a Bootstrapped Raw React Application with TypeScript

```cmd
npx create-react-app read-video-react-hooks --template typescript
```

### **CD** to the root directory of the application and install the library

```cmd
cd read-video-react-hooks
npm install dynamsoft-javascript-barcode
```

## Start to implement

### Add a file "dbr.ts" under "/src/" to configure the library

```ts
import { BarcodeReader } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode';
BarcodeReader.license = 'DLS2eyJvcmdhbml6YXRpb25JRCI6IjIwMDAwMSJ9';
BarcodeReader.engineResourcePath = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode/dist/";
```

> Note:
>
> * `license` specify a license key to use the library. You can visit https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?utm_source=sample&product=dbr&package=js to get your own trial license good for 30 days.
> * `engineResourcePath` tells the library where to get the necessary resources at runtime.

### Build directory structure

* Create a directory "components" under "/src/", and then create another three directories "HelloWorld", "VideoDecode" and "ImgDecode" under "/src/components/".

### Create and edit the `VideoDecode` component

* Create `VideoDecode.tsx` and `VideoDecode.css` under "/src/components/VideoDecode/". The `VideoDecode` component uses `BarcodeScanner` class of the library to help decode barcodes via camera.

* In `VideoDecode.tsx`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeScanner` instance.

```tsx
import { BarcodeScanner, TextResult } from "dynamsoft-javascript-barcode";
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import "./VideoDecode.css";

function VideoDecode() {
  const pScanner = useRef(null as null | Promise<BarcodeScanner>);
  const elRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      try {
        const scanner = (await (pScanner.current = BarcodeScanner.createInstance()));
        // Should judge if scanner is destroyed after 'await', as in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup in Strict Mode.
        if (scanner.isContextDestroyed()) return;
        await scanner.setUIElement(elRef.current!);
        // Should judge if scanner is destroyed after 'await', as in development React runs setup and cleanup one extra time before the actual setup in Strict Mode.
        if (scanner.isContextDestroyed()) return;
        scanner.onFrameRead = (results: TextResult[]) => {
          for (let result of results) {
            console.log(result.barcodeText);
          }
        };
        scanner.onUniqueRead = (txt: string, result: TextResult) => {
          alert(txt);
        };
        await scanner.open();
      } catch (ex: any) {
        if (ex.message.indexOf("network connection error")) {
          let customMsg =
            "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
          console.log(customMsg);
          alert(customMsg);
        }
        throw ex;
      }
    })();
    return () => {
      (async () => {
        if (pScanner.current) {
          (await pScanner.current).destroyContext();
          console.log("BarcodeScanner Component Unmount");
        }
      })();
    };
  }, []);

### Create and edit the `ImgDecode` component

* Create `ImgDecode.tsx` and `ImgDecode.css` under "/src/components/ImgDecode/". The `ImgDecode` component uses `BarcodeReader` class of the library to help decode barcodes in an image.

* In `ImgDecode.tsx`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeReader` instance.

```tsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import { BarcodeReader } from "dynamsoft-javascript-barcode";
import "./ImgDecode.css";

function ImgDecode() {
  const pReader = useRef(null as null | Promise<BarcodeReader>);

  const decodeImg = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    try {
      const reader = (await pReader.current)!;
      let results = await reader.decode(e.target.files![0]);
      for (let result of results) {
        alert(result.barcodeText);
      }
      if (!results.length) {
        alert("No barcode found");
      }
    } catch (ex: any) {
      if (ex.message.indexOf("network connection error")) {
        let customMsg =
          "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
        console.log(customMsg);
        alert(customMsg);
      }
      throw ex;
    }
    e.target.value = "";
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    pReader.current = BarcodeReader.createInstance();
    return () => {
      (async () => {
        if (pReader.current) {
          (await pReader.current).destroyContext();
          console.log("ImgDecode Component Unmount");
        }
      })();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="ImgDecode">
      <input type="file" onChange={decodeImg} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default ImgDecode;
```

* Define the style of the element in `ImgDecode.css`

```css
.ImgDecode {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border: 1px solid black
}
```

### Create and edit the HelloWorld component

* Create `HelloWorld.tsx` and `HelloWorld.css` under "/src/components/HelloWorld/". The `HelloWorld` component offers buttons to switch components between `VideoDecode` and `ImgDecode`;

* Add following code to `HelloWorld.tsx`.

```tsx
import "./HelloWorld.css";
import reactLogo from "../../logo.svg";
import "../../dbr"; // import side effects. The license, engineResourcePath, so on.
import { BarcodeReader } from "dynamsoft-javascript-barcode";
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import VideoDecode from "../VideoDecode/VideoDecode";
import ImgDecode from "../ImgDecode/ImgDecode";

function HelloWorld() {
  let [bShowScanner, setBShowScanner] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () => {
      try {
        await BarcodeReader.loadWasm();
      } catch (ex: any) {
        if (ex.message.indexOf("network connection error")) {
          let customMsg =
            "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
          console.log(customMsg);
          alert(customMsg);
        }
        throw ex;
      }
    })();
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="helloWorld">
      <h1>
        Hello World for React
        <img src={reactLogo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
      </h1>
      <div>
        <button
          style={{
            marginRight: "10px",
            backgroundColor: bShowScanner ? "rgb(255,174,55)" : "white",
          }}
          onClick={() => {
            setBShowScanner(true);
          }}
        >
          Video Decode
        </button>
        <button
          style={{
            backgroundColor: bShowScanner ? "white" : "rgb(255,174,55)",
          }}
          onClick={() => {
            setBShowScanner(false);
          }}
        >
          Image Decode
        </button>
      </div>
      <div className="container">
        {bShowScanner ? <VideoDecode></VideoDecode> : <ImgDecode></ImgDecode>}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HelloWorld;
```

> NOTE :
>
> * The method `loadWasm()` initializes the library in the background.

* Define the style of the element in `HelloWorld.css`

```css
.helloWorld {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    color: #455A64;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 1.5em;
}

button {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    margin: 1.5vh 0;
    border: 1px solid black;
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
}

.container {
    margin: 2vmin auto;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: medium;
    width: 80vw;
}
```

### Add the `HelloWorld` component to `App.tsx`

Edit the file `App.tsx` to be like this

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld/HelloWorld';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <HelloWorld></HelloWorld>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

* Try running the project.

```cmd
npm start
```

If you followed all the steps correctly, you will have a working page that turns one of the cameras hooked to or built in your computer or mobile device into a barcode scanner. Also, if you want to decode a local image, just click the `Image Decode` button and select the image you want to decode. Once barcodes are found, the results will show in a dialog. 

## Development server

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Build

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
