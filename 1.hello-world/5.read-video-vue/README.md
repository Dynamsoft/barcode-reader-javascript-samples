# JavaScript Hello World Sample - Vue

[Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is a progressive framework for building user interfaces. Check out the following guide on how to implement Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK (hereafter called "the library") into a Vue 2 application.

## Official Sample

* <a target = "_blank" href="https://demo.dynamsoft.com/Samples/DBR/JS/1.hello-world/5.read-video-vue/dist/">Hello World in Vue - Demo</a>
* <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/tree/main/1.hello-world/5.read-video-vue">Hello World in Vue - Source Code</a>

## Preparation

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. `node 14.21.3` and `vue 2.7.7` are used in the example below. 

## Create the sample project

### Create a Bootstrapped Raw React Application

```cmd
npm create vue@2
```

### **CD** to the root directory of the application and install the dependencies

```cmd
npm install
npm install dynamsoft-javascript-barcode
```

## Start to implement

### Add a file "dbr.js" under "/src/" to configure the library

```typescript
import { BarcodeReader } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode';
BarcodeReader.license = 'DLS2eyJvcmdhbml6YXRpb25JRCI6IjIwMDAwMSJ9';
BarcodeReader.engineResourcePath = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode/dist/";
```

> Note:
>
> * `license` specify a license key to use the library. You can visit https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?utm_source=sample&product=dbr&package=js to get your own trial license good for 30 days. 
> * `engineResourcePath` tells the library where to get the necessary resources at runtime.

### Create and edit the `VideoDecode` component

* Add a file `VideoDecode.vue` under "/components/" as the `VideoDecode` component. The `VideoDecode` component uses `BarcodeScanner` class of the library to help decode barcodes via camera.

* In `VideoDecode.vue`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeScanner` instance.

> Note:
>
> * The element with class name "component-barcode-scanner" is used to build the UI for the library in this line
>  
>   ```typescript

>  
> * To release resources timely, the `BarcodeScanner` instance is destroyed with the component in the callback `beforeDestroy` .

### Create and edit the `ImgDecode` component

* Add a file `ImgDecode.vue` under "/components/" as the `ImgDecode` component. The `ImgDecode` component uses `BarcodeReader` class of the library to help decode barcodes in an image.

* In `ImgDecode.vue`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeReader` instance.

```vue
<template>
  <div class="ImgDecode"><input type="file" @change="decodeImg" /></div>
</template>

<script>
import { BarcodeReader } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode'
export default {
  name: 'ImgDecode',
  data() {
    return {
      pReader: null,
    }
  },
  methods: {
    async decodeImg(e) {
      try {
        const reader = await (this.pReader = this.pReader || BarcodeReader.createInstance());
        let results = await reader.decode(e.target.files[0]);
        for (let result of results) {
          alert(result.barcodeText);
        }
        if (!results.length) { alert('No barcode found'); }
      } catch (ex) {
        let errMsg;
        if (ex.message.includes("network connection error")) {
          errMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
        } else {
          errMsg = ex.message||ex;
        }
        console.error(errMsg);
        alert(errMsg);
      }
      e.target.value = '';
    }
  },
  async beforeDestroy() {
    if (this.pReader) {
      (await this.pReader).destroyContext();
      console.log('ImgDecode Component Unmount');
    }
  },
}
</script>

<style scoped>
.ImgDecode {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border: 1px solid black
}
</style>
```

### Add `VideoDecode` and `ImgDecode` components in `HelloWorld.vue`

```vue
<template>
  <div class="helloWorld">
    <h1>Hello World for Vue<img class="applogo" alt="Vue logo" src="../assets/logo.png" /></h1>
    <div>
      <button :style="{ marginRight: '10px', backgroundColor: bShowScanner ? 'rgb(255,174,55)' : 'white' }"
        @click="showScanner">Video Decode</button>
      <button :style="{ backgroundColor: bShowImgDecode ? 'rgb(255,174,55)' : 'white' }" @click="showImgDecode">Image
        Decode</button>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <VideoDecode v-if="bShowScanner"></VideoDecode>
      <ImgDecode v-if="bShowImgDecode"></ImgDecode>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import "../dbr"; // import side effects. The license, engineResourcePath, so on.
import { BarcodeReader } from "dynamsoft-javascript-barcode";
import VideoDecode from "./VideoDecode";
import ImgDecode from './ImgDecode.vue'

export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  data() {
    return {
      bShowScanner: true,
      bShowImgDecode: false
    };
  },
  async mounted() {
    //Load the library on page load to speed things up.
    try {
      await BarcodeReader.loadWasm();
    } catch (ex) {
      let errMsg;
      if (ex.message.includes("network connection error")) {
        errMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
      } else {
        errMsg = ex.message||ex;
      }
      console.error(errMsg);
      alert(errMsg);
    }
  },
  components: {
    VideoDecode, ImgDecode
  },
  methods: {
    showScanner() {
      this.bShowScanner = true;
      this.bShowImgDecode = false;
    },
    showImgDecode() {
      this.bShowScanner = false;
      this.bShowImgDecode = true;
    }
  },
};
</script>

<!-- Add "scoped" attribute to limit CSS to this component only -->
<style scoped>
h1 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}

.applogo {
  height: 25px;
}

.helloWorld {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  color: #455a64;
}

button {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 2vh;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.container {
  margin: 2vmin auto;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: medium;
  width: 80vw;
}
</style>
```

> NOTE :
>
> * The method `loadWasm()` initializes the library in the background.

### Add the `HelloWorld` component to `App.vue`

Edit the file `App.vue` to be like this

```vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <HelloWorld />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import HelloWorld from "./components/HelloWorld.vue";

export default {
  name: "App",
  components: {
    HelloWorld,
  },
};
</script>

<style>
</style>
```

* Try running the project.

```cmd
npm run dev
```

If you followed all the steps correctly, you will have a working page that turns one of the cameras hooked to or built in your computer or mobile device into a barcode scanner. Also, if you want to decode a local image, just click the `Image Decode` button and select the image you want to decode. Once barcodes are found, the results will show in a dialog. 

## Project setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
