# JavaScript Hello World Sample - NuxtJS

[Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) is a higher-level framework that builds on top of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Check out the following guide on how to implement Dynamsoft Barcode Reader JavaScript SDK (hereafter called "the library") into a Nuxt application. Note that in this sample we will use `TypeScript`.

## Official Sample

* <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/Dynamsoft/barcode-reader-javascript-samples/tree/main/1.hello-world/8.read-video-nuxtjs">Hello World in Nuxt - Source Code</a>

## Preparation

Make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. `node 14.21.3` and `nuxt 3.2.3` are used in this article.

## Create the sample project

### Create a Bootstrapped Nuxt Application

```cmd
npx nuxi@latest init read-video-nuxtjs
```

You will be asked to configure quite a few things for the application during the creation. In our example, we chose the default one in every step.

### **CD** to the root directory of the application and install the dependencies

```cmd
cd read-video-nuxtjs
npm install dynamsoft-javascript-barcode
```

## Start to implement

### Add a file "dbr.ts" at the root of the app to configure the library

```typescript
import { BarcodeReader } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode';
BarcodeReader.license = 'DLS2eyJvcmdhbml6YXRpb25JRCI6IjIwMDAwMSJ9';
BarcodeReader.engineResourcePath = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/dynamsoft-javascript-barcode/dist/";
```

> Note:
>
> * `license` specify a license key to use the library. You can visit `https://www.dynamsoft.com/customer/license/trialLicense?utm_source=sample&product=dbr&package=js` to get your own trial license good for 30 days.
> * `engineResourcePath` tells the library where to get the necessary resources at runtime.

### Create a directory "components" and create the following files inside it to represent three components

* VideoDecode.vue
* ImgDecode.vue
* HelloWorld.vue

### Edit the `VideoDecode` component

* Add a file `VideoDecode.vue` under "/components/" as the `VideoDecode` component. The `VideoDecode` component uses `BarcodeScanner` class of the library to help decode barcodes via camera.

* In `VideoDecode.vue`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeScanner` instance.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { onBeforeUnmount, onMounted, ref, getCurrentInstance } from "vue";
import type { Ref } from 'vue'
import { BarcodeScanner } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode'

const pScanner: Ref<null | Promise<BarcodeScanner>> = ref(null);
const elRefs: Ref<null | HTMLElement> = ref(null);
onMounted(async () => {
  try {
    const internalInstance = getCurrentInstance();
    elRefs.value = internalInstance?.refs.elRefs as HTMLElement;
    const scanner = await (pScanner.value = BarcodeScanner.createInstance());
    await scanner.setUIElement(elRefs.value);
    scanner.onFrameRead = (results) => {
      for (let result of results) {
        console.log(result.barcodeText);
      }
    };
    scanner.onUniqueRead = (txt) => {
      alert(txt);
    }
    await scanner.open();
  } catch (ex:any) {
    let errMsg = ex.message||ex;
    if (errMsg.includes("network connection error")) {
      errMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
    }
    console.error(errMsg);
    alert(errMsg);
  }
});
onBeforeUnmount(async () => {
  if (pScanner.value) {
    (await pScanner.value).destroyContext();
    console.log('BarcodeScanner Component Unmount');
  }
});
</script>

> Note:

> * The element with class name "component-barcode-scanner" is used to build the UI for the library in this line
>  
>   ```typescript
>   await scanner.setUIElement(elRefs.value);
>   ```
>  
> * To release resources timely, the `BarcodeScanner` instance is destroyed with the component in the callback `onBeforeUnmount` .

### Edit the `ImgDecode` component

* Add a file `ImgDecode.vue` under "/components/" as the `ImgDecode` component. The `ImgDecode` component uses `BarcodeReader` class of the library to help decode barcodes in an image.

* In `ImgDecode.vue`, add code for initializing and destroying the `BarcodeReader` instance.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { onBeforeUnmount, ref } from "vue";
import type { Ref } from 'vue'
import { BarcodeReader } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode'

const pReader: Ref<null | Promise<BarcodeReader>> = ref(null);

const decodeImg = async (e:Event) => {
  try {
    const reader = await (pReader.value = pReader.value || BarcodeReader.createInstance());
    let results = await reader.decode((e.target as any).files[0]);
    for (let result of results) {
      alert(result.barcodeText);
    }
    if (!results.length) { alert('No barcode found'); }
  } catch (ex:any) {
    let errMsg = ex.message||ex;
    if (errMsg.includes("network connection error")) {
      errMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
    }
    console.error(errMsg);
    alert(errMsg);
  }
  (e.target as HTMLInputElement).value = '';
}
onBeforeUnmount(async () => {
  if (pReader.value) {
    (await pReader.value).destroyContext();
    console.log('ImgDecode Component Unmount');
  }
})

</script>

<template>
  <div class="ImgDecode"><input type="file" @change="decodeImg" /></div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.ImgDecode {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  border: 1px solid black
}
</style>
```

### Add `VideoDecode` and `ImgDecode` components in `HelloWorld.vue`

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import "../dbr"; // import side effects. The license, engineResourcePath, so on.
import { BarcodeScanner } from 'dynamsoft-javascript-barcode'
import VideoDecode from "./VideoDecode.vue";
import ImgDecode from './ImgDecode.vue'
import { ref, onMounted } from "vue";
import type { Ref } from 'vue'

const bShowScanner: Ref<boolean> = ref(true);
const bShowImgDecode: Ref<boolean> = ref(false)
onMounted(async () => {
  try {
    //Load the library on page load to speed things up.
    await BarcodeScanner.loadWasm();
  } catch (ex:any) {
    let errMsg = ex.message||ex;
    if (errMsg.includes("network connection error")) {
      errMsg = "Failed to connect to Dynamsoft License Server: network connection error. Check your Internet connection or contact Dynamsoft Support (support@dynamsoft.com) to acquire an offline license.";
    }
    console.error(errMsg);
    alert(errMsg);
  }
});
const showScanner = () => {
  bShowScanner.value = true;
  bShowImgDecode.value = false;
};
const showImgDecode = () => {
  bShowScanner.value = false;
  bShowImgDecode.value = true;
}
</script>

<template>
  <div className="helloWorld">
    <h1>Hello World for Nuxt</h1>
    <div>
      <button :style="{ marginRight: '10px', backgroundColor: bShowScanner ? 'rgb(255,174,55)' : 'white' }"
        @click="showScanner">Video Decode</button>
      <button :style="{ backgroundColor: bShowImgDecode ? 'rgb(255,174,55)' : 'white' }" @click="showImgDecode">Image
        Decode</button>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <VideoDecode v-if="bShowScanner"></VideoDecode>
      <ImgDecode v-if="bShowImgDecode"></ImgDecode>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
button {
  font-size: 1.5rem;
  margin-bottom: 2vh;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

.container {
  margin: 2vmin auto;
  text-align: center;
  font-size: medium;
  width: 80vw;
}

.applogo {
  height: 25px;
}

.helloWorld {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  color: #455a64;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 1.5em;
}
</style>
```

> NOTE :
>
> * The method `loadWasm()` initializes the library in the background.

### Add the `HelloWorld` component to `app.vue`

Edit the file `App.vue` to be like this

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <HelloWorld />
  </div>
</template>
```

* Try running the project.

```cmd
npm run dev
```

If you have followed all the steps correctly, you should now have a functioning page that allows you to scan barcodes from a webcam or a built-in camera. Additionally, if you want to decode a local image, you can click the `Image Decode` button and select the image you want to decode. Any barcodes that are detected will be displayed in a dialog.

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
