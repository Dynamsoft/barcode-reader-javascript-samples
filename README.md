## Customize Camera UI

* **Use the Default Camera UI**: Show the default camera UI to decode video stream from a USB-connected or built-in camera (mobile or desktop).
* **Hide Built-in Controllers**: Hide built-in UI elements (camera selection, resolution selection, etc.) and show only the video stream.
* **Use External Controllers**: Use custom controllers to manipulate the Camera UI.
* **Enlarge the Video Stream**: Enlarge the video stream temporarily to read a barcode.
