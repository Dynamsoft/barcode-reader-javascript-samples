# Native TypeScript samples

This directory contains TypeScript-based native examples demonstrating how to use the Dynamsoft Barcode Reader in TypeScript projects.

**Included examples**

- scan-using-foundational-api/ — TypeScript example with build config.
- scan-using-rtu-api/ — RTU API example in TypeScript.

## Quick start

1. Change to a subexample directory, e.g.:

   ```bash
   cd scan-using-foundational-api
   ```

2. Follow the subexample README for build/run steps (typically: npm install && npm run build / npm run dev).

## Notes

- Use the included build tooling (rollup/tsconfig) as described in each subexample.
- See the repository root README.md for general usage and license information.
